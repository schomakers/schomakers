Hey, 
my name is AndrÃ© and I'm a passionate medical informatics student at UMIT Tyrol. Additionally, I completed training as a board certified radiographer with work experience as e.g. the commissioned CT lead radiographer at CharitÃ© Berlin - one of the largest radiology departments in Europe. Currently I am working as a Junior Research Associate in the field of medical imaging, where I mainly perform data engineering tasks on radiological DICOM images.
